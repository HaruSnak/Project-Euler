# 🧠 Project Euler - Resolutions in C++

Here are my personal solutions to Project Euler problems, developed in C++, with the aim of improving my algorithms, mathematics, and code structuring. Most of the information needed to solve these problems is available online.

### Why undertake this project?

Since childhood, I have always had a passion for mathematics. The idea of ​​solving problems with unknown solutions has always fascinated me. However, my current level of mathematics is far from optimal, and one could even say that it is quite basic at this stage, especially when I initially wrote this README. Now, it's up to me to transform this simple foundation into a much more advanced and solid expertise.

## 🛠️ Compilation

Each folder contains a minimal `Makefile` for quick compilation:

```bash
cd 001-multiples-of-3-and-5
make
./euler001
```

## ✅ Exercise Summaries

<summary>001 - Multiples of 3 and 5 ⏳</summary>

### 📝 Problem
Find the sum of all integers less than 1000 that are multiples of 3 or 5.

### 💡 Solution Logic
- A for loop that iterates 1000 using a condition modulo 3 and 5 (== 0).
- I'm using a container when I could avoid an allocation just to perfect my learning since I just finished the CPP Modules of 42 at the moment.
